<p>HOLY CRAP, I <strong>FINALLY</strong> HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL BLOG!!!</p>

<p>Now that we've got it out of the way let me get to the point. And the point I would like to make is that <strong>getting up early is awesome</strong>. <br />
I am devoting my first post to this topic, because if I did not try getting up (very) early over the past week this blog wouldn't be here and I would still be one of those people who keep thinking about writing one.</p>

<p>I never had problems with getting up early. About a year ago I started going for a swim regularly at 7AM. This meant I had to get up around 6.30AM and that was what I defined as very early at the time. I was happy with this arrangement for a while, but recently I came to the conclusion that exercising is not the best use of my morning time. I might as well exercise in the afternoon, after work, when my mind is tired and useless, but my body is still up for it. <br />
Years of cramming for exams and delivering projects at the last minute made me think that late at night is the time when I do my best work, but recently I started suspecting that this is just a (bad) habit. This line of thinking was reinforced when I joined ABB two month ago and started working with <a href='https://twitter.com/rafek' >rafek</a>. I was impressed with the fact that he comes to work every day at 6AM and somehow manages to stay productive and enthusiastic throughout the day. We talked about it for a while and he recommended that I have a look at <a href='http://zenhabits.net/' >Zen Habits'</a> post about <a href='http://zenhabits.net/10-benefits-of-rising-early-and-how-to-do-it/' >10 Benefits of rising early</a>. It is a great read and I wholeheartedly recommend it!</p>

<p>All those thoughts and interactions inspired me to conduct an experiment which I am just finishing by writing this post. </p>

<ul>
<li>5.00 AM</li>
<li>4.40 AM</li>
<li>5.20 AM</li>
<li>4.30 AM</li>
<li>5.00 AM</li>
<li>9.00 AM</li>
<li>6.00 AM</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the times at which I got out of bed this week. Apart from Saturday, when I had to recover from staying up late, I managed to maintain a very early wake up schedule throughout the whole experiment. I got a lot of stuff done this week in the hours before starting my regular workday. It was amazing! I am so happy with the results that I am going to continue, but not as an expermient anymore. This is now going to be my standard behaviour. I can't wait to see how this affects my life (in a positive way, I hope :) ). I will report back with any observations as I move forward with this plan.</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.kubawalinski.com/first/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4c5ab9b3-1e42-4a66-a346-5ada6e0e43d8</guid><category><![CDATA[scrcrw]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kuba Waliński]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 07:02:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
